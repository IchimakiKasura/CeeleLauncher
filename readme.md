A very simple Game launcher for Mihoyo/Hoyoverse games on PC.<br>
the app is built based on my own preference.
</div>
<br>

## Features
- very Lightweight program (only uses less than 5mb | but needs an NET 7 runtime env)
- Ready to run no installation needed (unless you haven't installed the NET 7 runtime env)
- Open source
- Removed bloat links (such as socials)
- Shortcut buttons for Check-Ins | Map | Homepage | Screenshots.
- Modernized UI but still retain some few original design (barely).
- Knows when the game is outdated.

## Notes:
Games cannot be updated using this launcher. *yet*<br>
Instead it knows when the game has a new version available.

The App requires [NET-7](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/4b99bbc8-917a-417c-907b-d408341726a5/78b225344fbb9b80d3da3681e1d20d68/dotnet-runtime-7.0.5-win-x64.exe)

If you ever get a virus warning saying **"Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml"** its 100% false positive<br>
and if you're not sure about it, Feel free to clone this repository and build it your own.
