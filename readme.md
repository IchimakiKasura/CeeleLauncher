the app is built based on my own preference.

<br>

## [NOTICE TO USERS]
[HoyoPlay](https://hoyoplay.hoyoverse.com/) is now available as it is the official Hoyo's All-In-One game launcher for their games. <br>
Though the new HoyoPlay has some problems. <br>
1. The launcher size of it is almost 300+ MB
2. The side buttons doesn't include a link to direct to check-in rewards (though It might be added in the future.)
3. *unable to change launcher size? (I may only have 1 monitor so I cannot confirm if the launcher window resizes if the user have 4k monitor)
<br>

This could be the last time I'm updating and maintaining this project. Still, feel free to maintain or fork it.

## Features
- Very Lightweight program (only uses less than 5mb | but needs an NET 7 runtime env)
- Ready to run no installation needed (unless you haven't installed the NET 7 runtime env)
- Open source
- Removed bloat links (such as socials)
- Shortcut buttons for Check-Ins | Map | Homepage | Screenshots.
- Modernized UI but still retain some few original design (barely).
- Knows when the game is outdated.

## Notes:
The App requires [NET-7](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/4b99bbc8-917a-417c-907b-d408341726a5/78b225344fbb9b80d3da3681e1d20d68/dotnet-runtime-7.0.5-win-x64.exe)
