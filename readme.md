# Simple Hoyoverse Launcher
A very simple Hoyoverse launcher for Hoyoverse games on PC. the app is built based on my own preference.

## Features
- very Lightweight program (only uses less than 5mb | but needs an NET 7 runtime env)
- Ready to run no installation needed
- Open source
- Removed bloat links (such as socials)
- Shortcut button for Check-In depends on what game you currently picked.

If you want a more complex launcher you can try [Collapse Launcher](https://github.com/neon-nyan/Collapse)
